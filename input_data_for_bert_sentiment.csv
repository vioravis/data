17,41,86,17,01/08/2020,One key consideration here is whether a retail CBDC could and should have the samelegal tender status as banknotes and coins.,0,1,1

19,43,86,17,01/08/2020,"Withoutlegal tender status, the legal basis would need to be clarified, as would the relationship betweena CBDC and euro banknotes and coins, along with the process by which one could beexchanged for the other.",0,1,1
20,44,86,17,01/08/2020,"Should it not be acknowledged that the ECB’s exclusive right toauthorise issuance in euro would also be applicable to a digital issuance?A retail CBDC could be based on digital tokens, which would circulate in a decentralised manner– that is without a central ledger – and allow for anonymity towards the central bank, similar tocash.",1,1,1
21,45,86,17,01/08/2020,Some argue that a token-based digital currency might not guarantee complete anonymity,-1,1,1

27,56,86,20,01/08/2020,Themain reason is that introducing a retail CBDC could have major consequences for the financialsystem,0,1,1

31,66,86,28,01/08/2020,These potentially highly adverse effects on the financial system would appear to outweigh thebenefits envisaged by the introduction of a retail CBDC,-1,1,1
32,67,86,29,01/08/2020,"What, then, could be done to mitigate the impact of a CBDC on the financial system?One option could be to remunerate CBDC at below-market rates in order to create incentives fornon-banks to rely more on market-based alternatives rather than on central bank deposits.",0,1,2
33,71,86,30,01/08/2020,The central bank would have to refrain from setting a loweror a negative interest rate in order to keep a CBDC attractive to the public as a means ofpayment.,0,1,1

55,112,127,82,03/08/2020,And we’re not alone—a recent survey by the Bankfor International Settlements covering 66 central banks found that about 80 percent of them are6currently engaged in CBDC work and 10 percent are likely to issue a CBDC within three years,0,0,2
